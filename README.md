There is two version of the python file Hydro2,4. The hydro2 is written to do the first order simulation and hydro4 contain higher order methods whcih has the same problem as HLL Riemann solver(there is two version because I was working with two laptops one of them for doing simulations of first order formalism and second one to write the higher order method). I ran the code many times using first order method and sometimes(or 75% of the times) there was an overflow in code, in the cases which there was not an overflow sometimes the solution was like HLL without any reflecting wave (which was not obviously the case because the initail parameter didnt correspond to a black hole solution). I put the video  I made a video using 8000 time steps and 3000 spatial steps and as you see there is no reflecting wave even in the first order.
